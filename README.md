Optimize Matrix Multiplication in C

MM_Optimized = do Matrix Multiplication with various techniques and find the best results according to respective hardware devices.
MM_Thread = through MM_Optimized, I found the best way to do optimize Matrix Multiplication is by Loop Unrolling and combine it together with multithreading.
